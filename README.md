## Important Links

All links that have been or will be very important for development are found below.

### **Frontend**

I've decided to learn TypeScript I guess, so here are some important links:

*Note: I've ordered them in order that I should read them.*

1. [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) ✅ (*read the basics*)
2. [React Doc's TypeScript page](https://reactjs.org/docs/static-type-checking.html#typescript) ✅ (*added to project*)
3. [chibicode's beginner tutorial](https://ts.chibicode.com/todo/) ✅ (*finished*)
4. [React + TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#reacttypescript-cheatsheets) (*finished prereq, keep reading*)
5. [create-react-app + TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript) ✅ (*finished*)


#### *Developer Tools & Project Setup*
Note: It might not be a bad idea for me to get more familiar with industry-standard development tools and resources.

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)
* [ESLint: eslint-config-airbnb-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript)
* [React Debugging with VS Code](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor#visual-studio-code)
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (*ESLint config for coding style, probably not needed*)


#### *Other Links*

* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/components/grid/)
